Evolution of Flight - http://www.designingemergence.com/portfolio/evolution-of-flight/


Evolution is the most successful creative process in the world. Over the millennia, it has been responsible for designs that we wouldnâ€™t have come up with in our wildest dreams. With Evolution of Flight, I wanted to test whether I could use human intuition to speed up the evolutionary process and use it to design airplanes. 

Requirements:

  - Rhinoceros 3D
  - Rhinopython
  - Lasercutter or other means of testing designs
  - Test rig
  
Files:

  - Evolution of Flight.3dm: Rhino file containing 2 generations of evolved planes.
  - createPlane.py: Rhinopython script to create a single airplane
  - evolvePlanes.py: Full script to create and evolve all planes
  - generation0.p: File containing genetic info for initial generation
  - generation1.p: File containing genetic info for first generation
